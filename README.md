# EgyptJobData

This repository scrapes several job websites in Egypt to gather information on labor market demands.  This information can be useful for tracking occupational trends over time, informing educational investments and the design of curriculums that can help improve labor market outcomes.  The two repositories that are scraped are:
1. OLX.com
2. Wuzzuf.net

## scrape_Wuzzuf:  exports scraped data pages to csv with minimal data cleaning
## analyze_Wuzzuf: cleans the scraped dataset to turn it into a dataset that is more analyzable
## scrape_OLX:  exports scraped data pages to csv file.  The first part focuses simply on getting sectoral counts of job ads, while the second part of the code scrapes the individual job ad pages. This code is still in the process of being developed and finalized
